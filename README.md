# Word Counselor

## Inspiration
We wanted to make a project that used a library for analyzing emotions because we thought that it would be an interesting thing to dabble with. We believe that the existence of a service that provides linguistic assistance to non-native speakers may be useful.
## What it does
Word Counselor assists with determining the emotional impact of words or phrases in a body of text to show the user possible subjective connotation of his or her writing.
## How I built it
We used Indico's API by passing in string values and getting back JSON packets, which we managed with Ajax requests in our Javascript backend code of the website. In addition to traditional Javascript, we also made use of JQuery calls in our code.

## Challenges I ran into
We had some troubles with the design and implementation of the UI as well as the parsing and returning of data from the API that we used. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We made a website that does something yay nice wow.

## What I learned
Our team primarily learned a lot about web development and Javascript programming, as well as JQuery and Ajax.

## What's next for Word Counselor
Add a feature that scans the entire body of words, highlighting potential negatory and giving recommendations for each highlighted word.
